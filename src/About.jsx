        <h3>About</h3>
        <h4>
          I am a frontend developer with a deep passion for visual arts and
          photography, specializing in creating visually compelling and
          user-friendly web applications. Currently, I am halfway through my
          bachelor's degree in computer science and software engineering, which,
          combined with my hands-on experience, allows me to blend technical
          expertise with creative vision. I have completed a full-stack web
          development bootcamp, but my true interest lies in frontend
          development, where I can fully engage my visual creativity.
          <br />
          <br />I approach each project with a focus on aesthetic design, user
          experience, and seamless interaction, ensuring that every detail
          aligns with the overall vision. My self-taught journey in software
          development has equipped me with a diverse skill set, allowing me to
          adapt to new technologies and continuously refine my craft. Whether
          it's crafting a pixel-perfect interface or optimizing user flows, I am
          dedicated to delivering a cohesive and impactful digital experience.
